WebAR Full-Stack Product ViewerThis is a complete MERN-stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application built to demonstrate a modern, data-driven, 3D product viewer with Web-based Augmented Reality (WebAR) capabilities.The project moves beyond a simple "CRUD" app to show a "spatial computing" engine that integrates 3D graphics and real-world hardware (a phone's camera and motion sensors) to create an impressive, interactive user experience.🚀 Live DemoFrontend (Vercel): https://web-ar-mern-project.vercel.appBackend API (Render): https://webar-mern-project.onrender.com/api/productsNote: The backend is hosted on a free Render plan. It will "spin down" after 15 minutes of inactivity. The first load will be slow (it may take 30-60 seconds for the models to appear) as the server "wakes up." This is normal.📸 Screenshots3D Gallery (Mobile)3D Viewer (Desktop)AR Mode (Mobile)✨ Core FeaturesFull-Stack MERN Architecture: A true client-server application.Data-Driven Catalog: The 3D models are not hard-coded. The React frontend fetches the product list from a Node.js API, which gets its data from a MongoDB Atlas database.3D Thumbnail Gallery: A horizontally-scrolling UI that renders a live, auto-rotating 3D preview for every model in the database.Interactive 3D Viewer: A main 3D canvas that lets the user select a model and inspect it using orbit controls (zoom, pan, and rotate).WebAR Tap-to-Place: On compatible mobile devices (Chrome on Android, Safari on iOS), users can "Enter AR" to place the 3D model on any real-world surface.AR Model Scaling: Once in AR, + and - buttons appear, allowing the user to scale the placed model up or down.Robust Error Handling: An <ErrorBoundary> component wraps all 3D renders, preventing one "broken" model (like a complex .gltf) from crashing the entire application.Automated Database Seeding: A seed.js script to instantly populate the MongoDB database with the entire product catalog.🛠️ Technology StackFrontend (Client: Ar-Product-Viewer)React (with Vite): A fast, modern frontend framework.react-three-fiber (R3F): The main library for building 3D scenes in React.@react-three/drei: A helper library for R3F, used for:<OrbitControls> (3D view controls)<Center> (To safely center and scale all models)<useGLTF> (To load .glb and .gltf files)@react-three/xr: The official library for all WebAR features (<ARButton>, useHitTest, etc.).axios: Used to make API calls to the backend.Backend (Server: backend)Node.js: The JavaScript runtime for the server.Express.js: The framework used to build the REST API.Mongoose: An object data modeling (ODM) library to connect and manage data in MongoDB.cors: Middleware to allow the frontend (on Vercel) to make requests to the backend (on Render).dotenv: To protect the MongoDB database connection string.DatabaseMongoDB Atlas: A free-tier, cloud-hosted NoSQL database.DeploymentFrontend: Deployed to Vercel with continuous integration from GitHub.Backend: Deployed to Render with continuous integration from GitHub.🔌 Architecture & Data PipelineThis project consists of three independent services that communicate over the internet.User (Phone): Opens the Vercel (React) app.Frontend (Vercel): The app loads and immediately calls the Render API (GET /api/products).Backend (Render): The Node.js/Express server receives the request.Database (MongoDB): The server queries MongoDB Atlas for the list of all products.Data Flow: MongoDB sends the JSON data back to Render, which sends it back to the Vercel app.React Renders: The app receives the JSON, updates its state, and renders the gallery of 3D thumbnails.🖥️ How to Run LocallyPrerequisitesNode.js (v18+)GitA free MongoDB Atlas accountPostman (optional, for testing endpoints)1. Clone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/Himanshu2415411/WebAR_MERN_Project.git
cd WebAR_MERN_Project
2. Set Up the Backend (Server)Navigate to the backend folder:Bashcd backend
Install dependencies:Bashnpm install
Create a .env file in the backend folder and add your MongoDB connection string:# backend/.env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<your_username>:<your_password>@yourcluster.mongodb.net/ar_products
Run the database seeder to populate your database with all the models. (You can add more models to seed.js first!)Bashnode seed.js
Start the backend server:Bashnpm run dev
Your backend server is now running on httpss://localhost:5001.3. Set Up the Frontend (Client)Open a new terminal.Navigate to the frontend folder:Bashcd ../Ar-Product-Viewer
Install dependencies:Bashnpm install
Important: Open src/App.jsx and find the axios.get call (around line 195). Change the URL to point to your local backend server:JavaScript// Change this:
axios.get('https://webar-mern-project.onrender.com/api/products')

// To this:
axios.get('https://localhost:5001/api/products')
Start the frontend server (use --host to test on your phone):Bashnpm run dev -- --host
You can now open the httpss://... network URL on your phone to test the full application locally.🔮 Future WorkThis project is the perfect foundation for more advanced AI features, including:AI Sales Assistant: Integrate a chatbot (like Gemini or OpenAI) that can understand commands like "Show me the red car."Gesture Controls: Use a library like MediaPipe to control the AR scene with hand gestures.Image-to-3D: Integrate an API (like Ready Player Me or Luma AI) to let users turn their own photos into 3D models.
